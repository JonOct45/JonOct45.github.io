            is a portal that links students up with potential land lords based
            on the locations of the institutions they are attending. There are profiles

        <h2>This is About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! My name is Jonathan McGrath, and I live in San Francisco CA.
          This is going to be my about me where I put information about myself, and
          this information will range from personal to professional.

          It also could contain information about different locations I've lived and
          places I've been.

          Maybe it'll have information about animals and the ocean. . Who knows?!
